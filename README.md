#Refactoring_HW1
#First HW assignment for CBC

#Description
In this assignment I was tasked to refactor code, in other words, to make it readable, acessible, and to do a light debug.
Short descriptions were added, things were put in a logical order and fashion, and a link was fixed.
This was new for me in formatting this, so it was good learning and good practice.
